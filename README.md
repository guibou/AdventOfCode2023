My advent of code for 2023

Each days are in `src/DayN.hs`.

`src/DayX.hs` is the template to start each day, you can generate a new file using `src/startDay X`.

Starts a nix shell with `nix develop` (or use direnv).

`ghci` starts a repl, you can load your day with `:l DayXY`.

`Utils`, `Path`, `Direction` contains a shitload of utils, that I don't remember.

I'm targeting to run all problems in less than 1s.
